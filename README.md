# Tornado Expense Tracking

After every transaction, I receive an SMS like this:

```
YOUR CARD *4177 WAS AUTHORISED FOR WWW RIDENOW TECH, â‚¬5,15 AT 14:42
```

Thatâ€™s usefulâ€¦ but I was missing a simple place to track all my expenses and manage my budget.
So I built **Tornado Expense Tracking**.

This app is **open source** â€” feel free to fork it or open a PR.

## Why this app?

I looked for expense tracking apps on the Play Store.
While there are many great ones, most were either subscription-based or overloaded with features I didnâ€™t need.
I just wanted something **lightweight, private, and straightforward**.

When thereâ€™s a needâ€¦ you build your own. ðŸš€
